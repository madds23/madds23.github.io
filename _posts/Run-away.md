Hey everyone and welcome to our very first post with a suggested song! This is the only song that has been suggested so far, so please fill out the [form](/suggestionsform.md) and I'll make sure to stay updated and talk about what you want to hear. Today's song is ["Run Away"](https://youtu.be/MV27NJwIA2c?si=eCE8NU-ZpGc1sP6U) by [Ben Platt](https://www.instagram.com/bensplatt)!

This song comes off of Platt's album ["Sing to me Instead"](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lRmOhF6eykbRDoHbxLZtX_O8Ia_QIbpoQ&si=tGAQdrz2ISIQgf-a) and is the closer for the not deluxe album. This song is written and sung by Ben Platt and produced by Jennifer Decilveo, which makes this the second week in a row featuring songs with female producers! As I said, this is the closer of his debut album following his Broadway run in [Dear Evan Hansen](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nwNaw8KiCpogGv4gE_tiQcTTymDx9maSU&si=J6fii66pzn8-Yngw).
