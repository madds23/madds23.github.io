Hey guys!

I'm changing up how I'm running this website a little bit! As many of you know I've had lots of changes to my life in general. I got married, started a new job at BYU-Idaho radio, AND moved to a different place in Rexburg. After all that, I've realized my whole routine I was doing for the very beginning is now a little too overwhelming to continue right this second.

So from now on I am not doing videos with my analyzing posts. I will still do production project videos and covers of songs on my YouTube, so please go check that out. I will also still do frequent posts, but instead of having a schedule of when, it'll be whenever I feel like it or can do it. It might be multiple a week or a couple a month. Just depends on life and what I can get done! Another decision I've made is to move away from calling my website a "blog" and use website and articles more frequently.

Thanks for reading my articles. It really means a lot to me. I can't even express how happy writing these articles and I hope you're enjoying them!
