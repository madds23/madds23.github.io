SPONTANEOUS POST ALERT!

This weekend I was presented the opportunity to work on a mixing project. I was asked to create a cut of the new Imagine Dragons song ["Eyes Closed"](https://youtu.be/v08qmr8m_-w?si=BZ4l8u-WNdxQYnxC) to potentially be used in a larger project.

I was given a list of parts that were wanted in the cut and a couple more specifc requests like spaces and no lyrics to fulfill. I used Audacity and Ultimate Vocal Remover to achive the cut.

Since this is a spontaneous post, I'm just going to keep it short and simple and without too many details.

For the specific project there would need to be some parts cut out from this, but enjoy the "long cut" of this project!

Follow this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DyZ_692gK4) to listen on YouTube. I'm keeping this unlisted since it might be used in a bigger project.

Be on the look out for Ultimate Vocal Remover to be used in other posts because it is super fun to play with and can help improve my mixing skills!

Fill out the [form](/suggestionsform.md) so I can post what you want to hear! See you in our regularly scheduled post next week!
