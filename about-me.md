## About Me


Hi!

My name is Maddie Jones. I am a musician attending Brigham Young University- Idaho pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Music with an emphasis in Production. My instrument is the violin, although I play several others. During the Winter 2024 semester, I took a class called "Basic Audio Engineering" where we learned the basics of audio engineering (obviously... I'd be concerned if we didn't). We had a final project in that class where we had to show what we learned throughout the class. I've wanted to do videos about production and articles about reviewing songs and albums for a long time, but my fiance is the one who told me I should do a website. He had recently started a <a href="https://trevinjones.com">tech website</a> and thought it would be a great idea for me to do that as well. I currently run an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/musicbymadds23">Instagram</a> account for my music and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@musicbymadds23">YouTube</a> channel.

I will be posting articles about songs and albums I am analyzing onto this website. For now, there is no set schedule of when I will be posting as I am extremely busy and sticking to a schedule like that can be difficult. I'll be making a conscious effort to put up articles, but it won't be at a consistent time. I'll occasionally do production projects that will include a video! I will also have a <a href="/suggestionsform" >form</a> you can fill out to suggest songs or albums you want me to talk about or cover!

I hope you all enjoy these articles!
